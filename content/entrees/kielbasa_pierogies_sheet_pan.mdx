# 🥟 Kielbasa and Pierogies Sheet Pan Meal

A super easy, one-pan weeknight dinner. Crispy pierogies, smoky kielbasa, and roasted peppers and onions — minimal prep, minimal cleanup.

> Adapted from [Cooking in the Midwest](https://cookinginthemidwest.com/blog/kielbasa-pierogies-sheet-pan-meal/). My wife and I have been cooking this every week since we had our son — it's that good and that easy.

## Steps

<Steps>
### Preheat the oven
Preheat to 400°F (200°C).

### Prep your ingredients
Slice the peppers, onions, and kielbasa. Mix together the salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, garlic powder, onion powder, and smoked paprika in a small bowl.

### Season the pierogies
Add the frozen pierogies to a large bowl with a drizzle of olive oil. Toss to coat, then add about half the seasoning blend. Spread them in an even layer on one side of a large sheet pan sprayed with cooking spray.

### Season the kielbasa and veggies
Add the sliced peppers, onions, and kielbasa to the same bowl. Add the remaining seasoning, minced garlic, and a bit more olive oil. Toss to coat, then spread on the other side of the sheet pan.

### Bake
Bake for 25–30 minutes. Flip the pierogies and stir the veggies about halfway through. If the veggies release a lot of liquid, carefully pour it off and return to the oven.

### Broil (optional)
Broil for 2–3 minutes at the end to get everything nicely browned. Keep a close eye on it so nothing burns.

### Serve
Top with dried parsley. Serve with sour cream on the side.

## Notes

- Feeds 4 with no leftovers. For a larger family, use a full sheet pan for pierogies and a second for the kielbasa and veggies.
- You can slice the kielbasa and veggies ahead of time to cut down on prep.
- Use whatever seasonings or sausage your family likes — this is very forgiving.
- Short on time? Skip the fresh peppers and onion — half a bag of frozen pepper and onion medley works just as well.
