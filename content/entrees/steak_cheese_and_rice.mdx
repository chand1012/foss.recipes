## Steps

<Steps>
### Toast the rice
Rinse 1 cup of long grain white rice. Add to a skillet over medium-high heat with 2 tbsp olive oil. Stir the rice around, letting it toast up a bit.

### Cook the rice
Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, stir well. Pour in the chicken broth and tomato sauce. Season with salt, pepper, cumin, and dried cilantro. Stir and bring to a bubble. Cover, lower heat to medium-low, and cook about 20 minutes until rice is tender.

### Sear the steak
When the rice is about halfway done, melt 2 tbsp butter in a separate skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sliced steak and season with Montreal steak seasoning. Cook to your liking, then remove from heat.

### Assemble and serve
Fluff the rice with a fork. Top with the seared steak and drizzle heated white queso over everything. Garnish with fresh cilantro. Serve as-is or in warm flour tortillas.

## Notes

- Use long grain white rice, not instant/minute rice.
- Sirloin, strip steak, or skirt steak all work well.
- Any store-bought or homemade white queso works — Pancho's from Sam's Club is the original recommendation.
- Great topped with salsa, fresh pico de gallo, or taco sauce.
