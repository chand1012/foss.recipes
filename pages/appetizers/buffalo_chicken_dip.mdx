### Cook the chicken

Plain, grilled chicken breast is fine. No seasoning. If using a rotisserie chicken, remove the skin.

### Shred the chicken

A good method is to use two forks and pull the chicken apart.

### Combine ingredients in a slow cooker

### Cook on low until homogenous

### Serve with tortilla chips
