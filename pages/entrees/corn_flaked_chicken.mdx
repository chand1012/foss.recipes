## Steps

<Steps>
### Preheat the oven
Preheat the oven to 375¬∞F (190¬∞C).

### Season the chicken
Season the chicken with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and cayenne pepper. Seasoning the chicken directly will give it more flavour, and doing it before will give it time to soak in.

### Smash the corn flakes
How you do this is up to you, but don't smash them too small! You want some texture. I usually put them in a ziplock bag and use a rolling pin.

### Coat the chicken
Coat the chicken in the yogurt, then roll it in the corn flakes.

### Bake
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the crust is golden brown. Flipping them halfway through is optional, but I find it helps them cook more evenly.

### Enjoy!
Enjoy your crispy chicken!
