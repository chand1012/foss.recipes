# Gouda Mac and Cheese

Smoky take on my favorite comfort food. Inspired by Adam Ragusa's recipe, using the same food science principles to create a creamy, smoky, and cheesy sauce.

They key is the Sodium Citrate found in the processed American cheese. It's a salt that acts as an emulsifier, allowing the cheese to melt smoothly and evenly into the sauce. It also helps the cheese to stay smooth and creamy as it cools.

Serves 2 as a meal, 8 as a side.

## Steps

<Steps>
### Grate your cheese
Grating your own cheese is important because pre-shredded cheese is coated in a starch to prevent clumping. This starch will prevent the cheese from melting smoothly into the sauce. American Deluxe Deli cheese does not have this starch coating, so it's fine to use pre-sliced.

### Boil salted water for noodles

Get a pot of salted water coming to a boil for the noodles.

### Cook noodles

Get your noodles cooking in the boiling salted water.

### Combine ingredients for cheese sauce

In a cold pot, combine the milk (start with a smaller amount because you can add more later), cheese, sodium citrate (if using), and butter.

### Melt cheese sauce

Start melting the cheese sauce on medium-high heat, stirring constantly.

### Adjust cheese sauce consistency

Once the cheese sauce is totally melted and simmering, consider adding more milk if the sauce looks too thick. Remember, it will thicken as it cools to eating temperature.

### Drain noodles

Drain the cooked noodles.

### Combine noodles and cheese sauce

Stir the noodles into the cheese sauce.

### Add seasonings to taste

Add in any additional seasonings to taste, such as garlic and onion powder.

### Serve
