Free, Open, Straightforward and Simple Recipes for Everyone!

Tired of scrolling through countless ads and walls of text just to find a simple recipe? So were we. That's why FOSS.Recipes was born - a clutter-free, ad-free, and no-nonsense platform where you can find, share, and enjoy your favorite recipes with ease.

## Our Mission

As a software developer who loves to cook, our founder was fed up with recipe websites that prioritize ad revenue over user experience. FOSS.Recipes is our solution - a community-driven platform where food lovers can access and share their favorite recipes without any distractions or hidden agendas.

What You'll Find on FOSS.Recipes

1. Free and Open Recipes: Our recipe collection is accessible to everyone, free of charge.

2. Recipe First, Fluff Later: Our recipes are at the top of the page, so you don't have to scroll through a wall of text just to find what you're looking for.

3. Community Contributions: FOSS.Recipes is built on the principles of open-source collaboration. We encourage users to contribute their recipes, make improvements, and give feedback, so that we can continue to grow and improve our platform.

4. Easy-to-Follow Instructions: Our recipes are designed with simplicity in mind. Each one comes with a clear and concise list of ingredients, step-by-step instructions, and relevant notes or tips to ensure your cooking experience is as enjoyable as possible.
